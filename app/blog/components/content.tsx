            <br/>
            <p>I am Brent Iba√±ez, a 3rd Year Computer Science student at the Unversity of St. La Salle. I am currently 
                the Vice President for Programs at DEVCON Bacolod Chapter, a non-profit organization that empowers 
                Filipino developers. I am also the Chief Information Officer at Google DSC - USLS, a university 
                club in Bacolod. I was awarded a Full Scholarship by CHED in college due to my outstanding grades. 
                My dedication to acquiring knowledge is evident in my academic performance, as I have been a Dean&apos;s 
                List awardee for 5 consecutive semesters since enrolling. Along with this, I am also a DataCamp 
                scholar and a DICT scholar.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I am an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer and Data Science Professional, and I am very much looking 
                forward to pursue a career in this field. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained multiple online 
                certifications from Deeplearning.AI, Datacamp, IBM, and others. I have built my own Computer Vision 
                application that can identify plant diseases across multiple species, with a web and mobile application. 
                My dedication to empowering others shines through my work at DEVCON, where I create programs for 
                coders and non-coders alike through workshops and seminars. I am a multifaceted learner, balancing 
                my academics with certifications and training programs, continuously expanding my expertise in my 
                profession. My personal projects in data science and machine learning coupled with my leadership 
                experience demonstrates my ability to guide people, and drive meaningful impact. My technical 
                expertise and my ability to empower others allows me to make a positive impact to the 
                community.</p>
            <br/>
